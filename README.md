### Hi there, I'm Schalkie Wayne! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate coder with a love for games, parkour, and poetry. By day, I'm a software development enthusiast, and by night, I'm the real-life Bruce Wayne (minus the cape and cowl)!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring the world of software development, diving into various programming languages and frameworks to build exciting projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always eager to learn and grow, whether it's mastering a new coding language or perfecting my parkour moves in the concrete jungle.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative coding projects that challenge conventions and spark creativity. Let's build something amazing together!

âš¡ Fun fact: I once recited a poem while doing a backflip. Talk about multitasking!

Let's connect and create something extraordinary! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
